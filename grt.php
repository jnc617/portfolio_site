            <h4> Background </h4>

            <p> The process for completing internal access reviews at L3Harris Technologies was quite manual and arduous.  Certain employees would have to spend hours of their week creating spreadsheets from scratch, containing hundreds of manually entered cells to keep track of relevant information. </p>
            <p> There are two types of employees involved in this process: Coordinators - who initialize the access reviews and oversee the completion of the reviews (by making sure everyone is on track, all things going well, etc.) - and reviewers - who complete the access reviews by verifying or revoking access to applications that employees under them currently have access to. </p>
            <p>  I served as the UX Designer on an Agile team that included two developers and one systems engineer.  We were tasked with creating an internal web application that would automate a large portion of this process for employees that had stake in the access review process. </p>

            <h4> Goal </h4>

            <p> Design an internal web application with a positive user experience that improves the efficiency of system access reviews at L3Harris Technologies. This is a new application that needed designed and deployed in the span of the summer of 2019. </p>
