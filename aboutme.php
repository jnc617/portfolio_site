          <p>
            I'm Jacob, a User Experience Designer who loves to bridge the gap between humans and technology. I strive to bring beautiful, user-centered designs to tech that's built to improve lives everyday.  Currently, I am a senior at <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/" class="aboutMeLinks"> Cornell </a> studying Information Science, with a concentration in User Experience Design.  This past summer, I was a User Experience Intern at <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/" class="aboutMeLinks"> L3Harris Technologies </a>, and I am currently pursuing a full-time UX position upon the completion of my Bachelor's degree in May 2020.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Fall of 2018, I decided to take Human Computer Interaction Design, a junior level class at Cornell, and this class truly inspired me.  This class showed me not only how vital of a role technology plays in every day life, but how crucial it is that technology is usable by everyone - even the most lay users.  I quickly grew to love user experience design, as it serves as a way to express my creative problem solving skills through design while tackling real-world problems and driving social change.

            At Cornell, I am a designer and web developer for <a href="http://cuwelcomesrefugees.herokuapp.com/" class="aboutMeLinks"> Cornell Welcomes Refugees </a> and the Cornell Pakistani Student Association and a teaching assistant for Human Computer Interaction Design (<a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/search/roster/FA20?q=INFO%203450&days-type=any&crseAttrs-type=any&breadthDistr-type=any&pi=" class="aboutMeLinks">INFO 3450</a>).
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not designing, you can find me playing tennis, reading, relaxing outside, or playing guitar!  I strive to be a hard worker and a great team player, and I am always looking to take on new opportunities and tackle new design challenges.
